summary
## RACI Matrix and Role Refinement Discussion
- Current table structure needs improvement for clarity
  - Generic user role is confusing for auditors
  - Suggested roles: admin/owner, power users, read-only
  - Need to use GPT to define best roles for financial systems
- Will refine current matrix to proper RACI format within one week
- Document sharing planned via email for review

## Daily Progress Updates and Email Communication
- Progress updates coming from Central Alarm with subject "PBT"
- Ram started CSS submit process for daily updates
- Confirmed receipt of progress tracking emails

## User Authentication and Authorization Issues (Item 4)
- Status changed from "done" to "in progress - team validation"
- Application team needs to validate all fixes before marking complete
- Required: Email instructions to all 7 users with testing screenshots
- All users must confirm access and functionality
- Need evidence-based validation with screenshots

## Configuration and Display Issues Resolution
- Items 5-7 marked "to be validated" pending deployment
- Display duplication bug in user management interface fixed
- Browser compatibility issues (Item 9) - working in Chrome today
  - Possibly caching-related problem
  - User validation required from multiple team members
  - Screenshots needed for success/failure documentation

## Deployment Process and Environment Setup
- Current single dev/staging environment limitation discussed
- New deployment workflow established:
  - Report issue to vendor → Excel tracker → Fix on vendor instance → Deploy to Synchrony dev → UAT testing → Production
- Creating second dev environment for vendor testing before application team validation
- Madhu leading new environment setup with Anusha as backup
- Existing environment becomes UAT/staging for application team

## Technical Architecture Priorities (High Priority Items)
- Item 2: Implement config maps for Kubernetes containers (critical)
- Item 5: Fix UI service to call API service internally via core DNS
  - Currently going outside cluster causing cross-domain issues
  - Complicating ingress setup unnecessarily
- These fixes required before items 1 and 3 can be completed

## Project Management and Tracking
- Excel tracker sufficient for now, no over-engineering needed
- Remove multiple date tabs, use single tracker with filters
- Filter by status: validated, in progress, open
- Optional ticket system (Zoho, Jira) for vendor use
- SharePoint access verification needed

## Technical Meeting Scheduled
- Tomorrow 10:00-10:30 AM
- Attendees: Ravi, Madhu, Dimitri (CC)
- Focus: Kubernetes architecture, config maps, internal service communication
- Application team optional attendance
- Meeting notes to be shared post-meeting

## Access and Security Governance
- Vendor team has Synchrony SSO access for other projects
- No direct cluster access permitted - only through Ravi
- Source code in vendor GitHub repository
- Images scanned via external pipeline before Harbor deployment
- Segmentation of duties maintained for security

## Browser Compatibility Investigation
- Issue resolved in incognito mode, suggesting caching problem
