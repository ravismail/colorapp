Meeting
Meeting Overview and Goals
Primary goal: Enable Lita and team to use Synacron application immediately
Focus: Make Lita happy with user experience - if not happy, continue working until resolved
Meeting attendees: Lita (user), Joshua (testing expert), Ravi (engineer - Kubernetes/containers), Dimiter (lead), Rob (user), vendor team
Current User Access Problems
Lita initially blocked from tools section - clicking tools menu items produced no response
Required opening new browser tab and re-entering credentials to gain access
Rob unable to save bin configurations despite following exact same steps as Lita
Authentication working but authorization failing for certain users
Browser compatibility issues - Chrome incognito failed, Microsoft Edge worked
HTTPS/HTTP redirect issues preventing proper login
Technical Architecture Issues Identified
User management siloed per individual - each user must configure own bin settings
Bin configurations not shared across users (user-specific, not global)
Card upload and merchant configurations are shared/visible to other users
Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation problems
User authentication handled by acquirer service, bin configuration by issuer service
Hardcoded URLs in frontend code preventing proper ingress configuration
Missing user records in issuer service database causing save failures
Browser and Access Troubleshooting
Cache clearing resolved some access issues
Incognito mode recommended for testing
Developer tools (F12) not accessible in Edge browser
HTTP vs HTTPS redirect problems with ingress configuration
TLS certificate issues mentioned for future resolution
User Role and Permission Matrix Discussion
Current confusion about which features are global vs user-specific
Requested comprehensive matrix showing:
All system entities (left column)
Different user types (admin, developer, power user, read-only)
Read/write permissions for each combination
Due date: Matrix required by tomorrow for review
Will serve as binding agreement for access control implementation
Specific Technical Errors
"User not found" errors when saving bin configurations
Display duplication bug in user management (cosmetic but concerning)
ACT vs Active status inconsistencies in user interface
Backend pod connectivity issues
Database access problems for debugging
Vendor Accountability and Project Management
Dimiter emphasized this is paid service, not hobby project
Vendor responsible for internal testing before client delivery
Requested formal project management approach:
Ticket system with numbers and ETAs
Daily email progress reports
Dedicated project manager
Proper defect tracking (not chat-based)
Contract fulfillment concerns raised - potential termination grounds mentioned
Priority Resolution Framework
Priority 1-4: User experience issues (immediate resolution required)
Priority 5-9: Technical architecture issues (secondary priority)
Timeline: Fix critical issues this week, maximum next week
All users must have identical administrative capabilities
Resource and Time Management
Ravi (top engineer) currently migrating 1,136 services to cloud for holiday season
Vendor team cannot use client resources for debugging
Structured meeting approach required with agendas
Vendor must establish own testing environment before client deployment
Action Plan Moving Forward
Vendor to discuss with management immediately
Daily progress updates required
Comprehensive user guide and demo session planned
Technical fixes prioritized by user impact
Separate meeting scheduled for ingress and container issues
Action Items
Vendor team discuss all issues with management immediately
Create comprehensive user role/permission matrix by tomorrow
Establish formal project management with ticket system and ETAs
Provide daily email progress updates
Fix user authentication/authorization issues across all users (Priority 1-4)
Resolve bin configuration save failures for all users
Test application thoroughly in vendor environment before client deployment
Schedule separate technical meeting for ingress/container hardcoded URL issues
Create proper defect tracking system (replace chat-based communication)
Assign dedicated project manager to track issues and resolutions
Fix display duplication bug in user management interface
Resolve browser compatibility issues (Chrome vs Edge)
Document all technical architecture decisions and share with client team
